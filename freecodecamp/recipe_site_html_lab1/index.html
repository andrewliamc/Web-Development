    <h1>Rabo Encendido - Oxtail Stew</h1>

    <p>Rabo encendido or rabo guisado is a rich, vegetable-rich spicy oxtail stew recipe. This is a very delectable dish that we typically serve on special occasions due to the time it takes to prepare. I can tell you, however, that every minute it takes to make it is worth it in the end.</p>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>To season the oxtail, place it in a large bowl and add oregano, black pepper, lime juice, and a tablespoon of salt. Let it rest covered in the fridge for an hour or two.</li>
        <li>Once it has rested, heat the vegetable oil in a large pot or, preferably, a large dutch oven over medium-high heat.
Stir in oxtail and cook stirring until it browns. It may release some liquid, just let it evaporate eventually and cook until it browns.</li>
        <li>After browning the oxtail, add a cup of water, and cover with a tight-fitting lid.
Reduce heat to medium and simmer covered until the meat is very tender, uncovering and stirring every 5 minutes or so, and adding small amounts of water as it becomes necessary to prevent it from scorching.
This may take about an hour (or more), depending on the quality and freshness of the oxtail. You can shorten the time by using a pressure cooker or Instant Pot. See the instructions in the notes below.</li>
        <li>When the meat is very tender (test with a fork), let the water reduce and add the carrots, chickpeas, olives, onion, cubanelle pepper, thyme, tomatoes, tomato sauce, celery, garlic, and Scotch bonnet pepper to the pot. Cook, stirring, until onions become translucent.
Add 1 ¼ cup of water, and simmer covered until the carrots are cooked through.</li>
